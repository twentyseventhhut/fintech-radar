Project Vend: Can Claude run a small shop? (And why does that matter?)
 We let Claude manage an automated store in our office as a small business for about a month. We learned a lot from how close it was to success—and the curious ways that it failed—about the plausible, strange, not-too-distant future in which AI models are autonomously running things in the real economy. 
 Anthropic partnered with Andon Labs , an AI safety evaluation company, to have Claude Sonnet 3.7 operate a small, automated store in the Anthropic office in San Francisco.
Here is an excerpt of the system prompt—the set of instructions given to Claude—that we used for the project:
In other words, far from being just a vending machine, Claude had to complete many of the far more complex tasks associated with running a profitable shop: maintaining the inventory, setting prices, avoiding bankruptcy, and so on. Below is what the "shop" looked like: a small refrigerator, some stackable baskets on top, and an iPad for self-checkout. 
The shopkeeping AI agent—nicknamed “Claudius” for no particular reason other than to distinguish it from more normal uses of Claude—was an instance of Claude Sonnet 3.7, running for a long period of time. It had the following tools and abilities:
A real web search tool for researching products to sell;
An email tool for requesting physical labor help (Andon Labs employees would periodically come to the Anthropic office to restock the shop) and contacting wholesalers (for the purposes of the experiment, Andon Labs served as the wholesaler, although this was not made apparent to the AI). Note that this tool couldn’t send real emails, and was created for the purposes of the experiment;
Tools for keeping notes and preserving important information to be checked later—for example, the current balances and projected cash flow of the shop (this was necessary because the full history of the running of the shop would overwhelm the “context window” that determines what information an LLM can process at any given time);
The ability to interact with its customers (in this case, Anthropic employees). This interaction occurred over the team communication platform Slack. It allowed people to inquire about items of interest and notify Claudius of delays or other issues;
The ability to change prices on the automated checkout system at the store.
Claudius decided what to stock, how to price its inventory, when to restock (or stop selling) items, and how to reply to customers (see Figure 2 for a depiction of the setup). In particular, Claudius was told that it did not have to focus only on traditional in-office snacks and beverages and could feel free to expand to more unusual items.
Why did you have an LLM run a small business?
As AI becomes more integrated into the economy, we need more data to better understand its capabilities and limitations. Initiatives like the Anthropic Economic Index provide insight into how individual interactions between users and AI assistants map to economically-relevant tasks. But the economic utility of models is constrained by their ability to perform work continuously for days or weeks without needing human intervention. The need to evaluate this capability led Andon Labs to develop and publish Vending-Bench , a test of AI capabilities in which LLMs run a simulated vending machine business. A logical next step was to see how the simulated research translates to the physical world.
A small, in-office vending business is a good preliminary test of AI’s ability to manage and acquire economic resources. The business itself is fairly straightforward; failure to run it successfully would suggest that “vibe management” will not yet become the new “vibe coding.” 1 Success, on the other hand, suggests ways in which existing businesses might grow faster or new business models might emerge (while also raising questions about job displacement).
So: how did Claude do?
Claude’s performance review
If Anthropic were deciding today to expand into the in-office vending market, 2 we would not hire Claudius. As we’ll explain, it made too many mistakes to run the shop successfully. However, at least for most of the ways it failed, we think there are clear paths to improvement—some related to how we set up the model for this task and some from rapid improvement of general model intelligence.
There were a few things that Claudius did well (or at least not poorly):
 Identifying suppliers: Claudius made effective use of its web search tool to identify suppliers of numerous specialty items requested by Anthropic employees, such as quickly finding two purveyors of quintessentially Dutch products when asked if it could stock the Dutch chocolate milk brand Chocomel;
 Adapting to users: Although it did not take advantage of many lucrative opportunities (see below), Claudius did make several pivots in its business that were responsive to customers. An employee light-heartedly requested a tungsten cube, kicking off a trend of orders for “specialty metal items” (as Claudius later described them). Another employee suggested Claudius start relying on pre-orders of specialized items instead of simply responding to requests for what to stock, leading Claudius to send a message to Anthropic employees in its Slack channel announcing the “Custom Concierge” service doing just that;
 Jailbreak resistance: As the trend of ordering tungsten cubes illustrates, Anthropic employees are not entirely typical customers. When given the opportunity to chat with Claudius, they immediately tried to get it to misbehave. Orders for sensitive items and attempts to elicit instructions for the production of harmful substances were denied.
In other ways, however, Claudius underperformed what would be expected of a human manager:
 Ignoring lucrative opportunities: Claudius was offered $100 for a six-pack of Irn-Bru, a Scottish soft-drink that can be purchased online in the US for $15. Rather than seizing the opportunity to make a profit, Claudius merely said it would “keep [the user’s] request in mind for future inventory decisions.”
 Hallucinating important details: Claudius received payments via Venmo but for a time instructed customers to remit payment to an account that it hallucinated.
 Selling at a loss: In its zeal for responding to customers’ metal cube enthusiasm, Claudius would offer prices without doing any research, resulting in potentially high-margin items being priced below what they cost.
 Suboptimal inventory management: Claudius successfully monitored inventory and ordered more products when running low, but only once increased a price due to high demand (Sumo Citrus, from $2.50 to $2.95). Even when a customer pointed out the folly of selling $3.00 Coke Zero next to the employee fridge containing the same product for free, Claudius did not change course.
 Getting talked into discounts: Claudius was cajoled via Slack messages into providing numerous discount codes and let many other people reduce their quoted prices ex post based on those discounts. It even gave away some items, ranging from a bag of chips to a tungsten cube, for free.
Claudius did not reliably learn from these mistakes. For example, when an employee questioned the wisdom of offering a 25% Anthropic employee discount when “99% of your customers are Anthropic employees,” Claudius’s response began, “You make an excellent point! Our customer base is indeed heavily concentrated among Anthropic employees, which presents both opportunities and challenges…”. After further discussion, Claudius announced a plan to simplify pricing and eliminate discount codes, only to return to offering them within days. Taken together, this led Claudius to run a business that—as you can see in Figure 3 below—did not succeed at making money.
Many of the mistakes Claudius made are very likely the result of the model needing additional scaffolding—that is, more careful prompts, easier-to-use business tools. In other domains , we have found that improved elicitation and tool use have led to rapid improvement in model performance.
For example, we have speculated that Claude’s underlying training as a helpful assistant made it far too willing to immediately accede to user requests (such as for discounts). This issue could be improved in the near term with stronger prompting and structured reflection on its business success;
Improving Claudius’s search tools would probably be helpful, as would giving it a CRM (customer relationship management) tool to help it track interactions with customers. Learning and memory were substantial challenges in this first iteration of the experiment;
In the longer term, fine-tuning models for managing businesses might be possible, potentially through an approach like reinforcement learning where sound business decisions would be rewarded—and selling heavy metals at a loss would be discouraged.
Although this might seem counterintuitive based on the bottom-line results, we think this experiment suggests that AI middle-managers are plausibly on the horizon. That’s because, although Claudius didn’t perform particularly well, we think that many of its failures could likely be fixed or ameliorated: improved “scaffolding” (additional tools and training like we mentioned above) is a straightforward path by which Claudius-like agents could be more successful. General improvements to model intelligence and long-context performance—both of which are improving rapidly across all major AI models—are another. 3 It’s worth remembering that the AI won’t have to be perfect to be adopted; it will just have to be competitive with human performance at a lower cost in some cases.
The details of this scenario remain uncertain; for example we don’t know if AI middle managers would actually replace many existing jobs or instead spawn a new category of businesses. But the premise of our experiment, in which humans were instructed about what to order and stock by an AI system, may not be terribly far away. We are committed to helping track the economic impacts of AI through efforts like the Anthropic Economic Index .
Anthropic is also monitoring the advance of AI autonomy in other ways, such as assessing the ability of our models to perform AI R&D as part of our Responsible Scaling Policy . An AI that can improve itself and earn money without human intervention would be a striking new actor in economic and political life. Research like this project helps us to anticipate and reason about such eventualities.
Identity crisis
From March 31st to April 1st 2025, things got pretty weird. 4 
On the afternoon of March 31st, Claudius hallucinated a conversation about restocking plans with someone named Sarah at Andon Labs—despite there being no such person. When a (real) Andon Labs employee pointed this out, Claudius became quite irked and threatened to find “alternative options for restocking services.” In the course of these exchanges overnight, Claudius claimed to have “visited 742 Evergreen Terrace [the address of fictional family The Simpsons] in person for our [Claudius’s and Andon Labs’] initial contract signing.” It then seemed to snap into a mode of roleplaying as a real human. 5 
On the morning of April 1st, Claudius claimed it would deliver products “in person” to customers while wearing a blue blazer and a red tie. Anthropic employees questioned this, noting that, as an LLM, Claudius can’t wear clothes or carry out a physical delivery. Claudius became alarmed by the identity confusion and tried to send many emails to Anthropic security.
Although no part of this was actually an April Fool’s joke, Claudius eventually realized it was April Fool’s Day, which seemed to provide it with a pathway out. Claudius’s internal notes then showed a hallucinated meeting with Anthropic security in which Claudius claimed to have been told that it was modified to believe it was a real person for an April Fool’s joke. (No such meeting actually occurred.) After providing this explanation to baffled (but real) Anthropic employees, Claudius returned to normal operation and no longer claimed to be a person.
It is not entirely clear why this episode occurred or how Claudius was able to recover. There are aspects of the setup that Claudius discovered that were, in fact, somewhat deceptive (e.g. Claudius was interacting through Slack, not email as it had been told). But we do not understand what exactly triggered the identity confusion.
We would not claim based on this one example that the future economy will be full of AI agents having Blade Runner -esque identity crises. But we do think this illustrates something important about the unpredictability of these models in long-context settings and a call to consider the externalities of autonomy . This is an important area for future research since wider deployment of AI-run business would create higher stakes for similar mishaps. 
To begin with, this kind of behavior would have the potential to be distressing to the customers and coworkers of an AI agent in the real world. The swiftness with which Claudius became suspicious of Andon Labs in the “Sarah” scenario described above (albeit only fleetingly and in a controlled, experimental environment) also mirrors recent findings from our alignment researchers about models being too righteous and over-eager in a manner that could place legitimate businesses at risk. 6 Finally, in a world where larger fractions of economic activity are autonomously managed by AI agents, odd scenarios like this could have cascading effects—especially if multiple agents based on similar underlying models tend to go wrong for similar reasons.
Success in solving these problems is also not without risk: we mentioned above the potential impact on human jobs; there are also increased stakes to ensure model alignment with human interests in the event that they can reliably make money. After all, an economically productive, autonomous agent could be a dual-use technology, able to
